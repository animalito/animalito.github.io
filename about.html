## About

I love my work, dancing, music and travelling (sometimes in that order). The first verses mainly on trying to create metrics that empower public policy makers and allow them to make decisions based on evidence. The second and third I must confess I do wherever and whenever the fancy strikes. Travel is my passion. Whether it is on crappy night buses because I cannot afford paying for a hostel, bike touring or enjoying stranger's hospitality, I love it.
